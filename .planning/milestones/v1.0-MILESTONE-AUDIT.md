## Tech Debt

Non-critical items for future consideration:

1. **SESN-01/SESN-02 relaxed** — Sessions are in-memory only (explicit user decision). Cross-restart persistence deferred.
2. **REQUIREMENTS.md traceability** — Phase 3 items still show "Pending" in traceability table (cosmetic).
3. **No rate limiting** — Users can spawn unlimited concurrent sessions.
4. **No disk cleanup** — Claude CLI history/cache files accumulate.
5. **Single owner only** — No multi-user or role-based access (by design, in Out of Scope).

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0 delivers its core value: **full bidirectional Claude Code access from Discord**. All 26 requirements satisfied, all 3 phases verified, all cross-phase integration confirmed. Ready for completion.
